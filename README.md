# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I write programs that are maintable, readable and adaptable by ensuring that I understand the intention of the program. This allows me to account for any adaptations that may need to be done in the future. I also write programs with the intention that someone may have to work behind me and as such I try to make it as clear and understandable as possible. One advantage of working this way was being able to utilize this module in the future. Another way I could use the CRUD Python module in the future is with another instance of MongoDB.


# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist I approach a problem by by first making sure that I understand what the problem is, the creating a plan of action and then working on that plan step by step. My approach to the dashboard requirements that Grazioso did not vary much from previous assignments in othr course. The approach that I use typically works for me and as such I try not to stray far from it. One technique that I would use in the future to create databases would be precision and attention to detail. Databases deal with managing data and as such it is very imortant thab these data are managed with precision so that none of the data is lost or corrupted.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientist analyze and develop the software and hardware used to solve problems in various areas of life. This matters because it allows for an increase in productivity in various industries and areas of life. My work on this type of project would help a company, like Grazioso Salvare by helping to imporve productivity and efficiency. Working on a project like Grazioso's provides the company with information about their company processes that they can then utilize to maximize efficiency.
